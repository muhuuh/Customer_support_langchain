# Customer Support LangChain

This project provides a simple customer support interface using LangFlow. The interface is built with Streamlit and allows users to interact with a pre-defined LangFlow chart for customer support automation.

## Features

- User-friendly Streamlit interface for chatting with the LangFlow-powered bot.
- Backend integration with Datastax Astra LangFlow API.
- Customizable flow with endpoint management.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- A Datastax Astra LangFlow instance with an active flow.

   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add your LangFlow Application Token:

## Usage

1. Start the Streamlit application:

   ```bash
